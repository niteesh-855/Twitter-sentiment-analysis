*DESCRIPTION*:
            This project focuses on classifying the sentiment of tweets into Positive, Neutral, or Negative using natural language processing and machine learning. The dataset contains real-world tweets along with metadata such as hashtags and user information. Text data was preprocessed and fed into an RNN model to capture sequential patterns in the language. The model was trained and evaluated based on its accuracy in classifying sentiments. This project demonstrates the use of deep learning for sentiment analysis in social media platforms like Twitter.
